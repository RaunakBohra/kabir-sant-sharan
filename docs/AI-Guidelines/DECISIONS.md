**Decision**: Enable TypeScript strict mode for all components and services
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Better code quality and fewer runtime errors
- ✅ Improved developer experience with IntelliSense
- ✅ Self-documenting code
- ❌ Slightly slower initial development

### D004: Component-First Architecture (2024-09-29)

### D005: Free-Tier Technology Stack (2024-09-29)
**Status**: Superseded by D008
**Context**: Budget constraint of $0-5/month for lifetime operation
**Decision**: Use only free-tier services (Vercel, Railway, Cloudinary, Kit/ConvertKit)
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Extremely low operational costs
- ✅ Professional-grade services
- ❌ Usage limitations on free tiers
- ❌ Potential migration needs if community grows significantly
**Superseded By**: D008 - Cloudflare Full-Stack Migration provides better cost efficiency and performance

### D006: English/Nepali Bilingual Support (2024-09-29)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Target audience includes local Nepali community and English speakers
**Decision**: Implement bilingual support with language switcher
**Consequences**:

- ✅ Better accessibility for local members
- ❌ Additional content management complexity
- ❌ Increased translation maintenance

### D007: Mobile-First Responsive Design (2024-09-29)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Community members likely access site primarily via mobile devices
**Decision**: Implement mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Optimal mobile experience
- ✅ Better performance on slower devices
- ✅ Improved accessibility
- ❌ Requires careful desktop optimization

### D008: Cloudflare Full-Stack Migration (2024-09-29)
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Need cost-effective, scalable infrastructure for global spiritual community
**Decision**: Migrate from Supabase/Vercel to full Cloudflare stack (Pages + D1 + Workers + R2)
**Consequences**:
- ✅ Zero operational cost ($0/month guaranteed)
- ✅ Global CDN performance for worldwide access
- ✅ Simplified single-vendor architecture
- ✅ Built-in security (DDoS, WAF protection)
- ✅ Edge computing for optimal performance
- ❌ Learning curve for D1 (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)
- ❌ Custom authentication implementation required
- ❌ Limited to 5GB database on free tier
**Alternatives Considered**: Supabase + Vercel, Railway, Netlify + Upstash
**Review Date**: 2025-03-29
